### TGIF, RITE?

You made it! AND you learned so many new things. LET'S PRACTICE THEM.

Over the course of the weekend, we are going to be creating a Blog! You will be able to Create, Read and Delete each of your blog posts... A real live CRD application using all the things we've learned this week.


#### Part One: Node/Express!

Let's set up a back-end with our newly found pals, Node and Express! You'll only need an index route and an API route. Let's think about rendering everything for this on a single page!

#### Part Two: MONGO.

Use Mongo to store the information for each blog post. Use Mongoose to connect your database to your application.

#### Part Three: Front-End!

Your front-end should use AJAX to make calls to you API. Like you did last night, think about how your requests to your server should be going through AJAX!

#### Additional Things...

Again, make this app one that you would **ACTUALLY** want to use yourself. What kinds of features would you want it to have?
- Do you want your blog posts to have the date on them?
- Do you want to categorize them?
- Is there something you could use instead of a text input to handle all of the content you want to include in a blog post?

#### Submission

You can probably push your work to github with your eyes closed now, but **PLEASE** make sure you have it submitted by Sunday evening at 11:59pm!

### Have a nice weekend!
